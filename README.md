Blackjack Game (Python)

Introduction

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. You play against the computer, trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, including hitting, standing, and handling Aces dynamically.

Features

Play against the computer with automatic dealer logic.
Aces automatically adjust from 11 to 1 if necessary to avoid busting.
The dealer follows standard Blackjack rules (hits until at least 17).
Clean and readable code, structured with functions.
How to Play

The game starts by dealing two cards to you and the dealer.
You can choose to:
Hit (y) → Take another card.
Stand (n) → Keep your current hand.
If your total goes above 21, you lose automatically.
After you stand, the dealer will draw cards until reaching 17 or higher.
The game then compares scores and determines the winner.
Winning Conditions

If you get 21 with two cards → Blackjack! You win!
If the dealer goes over 21, you win automatically.
If you go over 21, you lose automatically.
If your score is higher than the dealer’s, you win.
If both scores are the same, it's a draw.
How to Run the Game

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Download the script or copy it into a Python file (blackjack.py).
Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:
python blackjack.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
Future Improvements

Add betting system with virtual money.
Implement multiple rounds instead of restarting every game.
Add a graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter or Pygame.
